The original `TypeExpr<'a>` borrowed strings for zero-copy parsing, which worked fine when `TypeExpr` was immediately converted to owned types like `SignatureType`. However, the type derivation changes introduced `TypeDerivation` that stores `TypeExpr` directly—it lives in `Impl`, which lives in `Registry` for the program's lifetime. Now `TypeExpr` needed to outlive the parsing function's input string. The previous solution used `Box::leak` to force a `'static` lifetime, intentionally leaking memory. Since YAML deserialization already produces owned `String` values, we changed `TypeExpr` to own its strings directly, eliminating the leak at the cost of small one-time allocations during startup.
